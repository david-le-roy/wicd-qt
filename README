wicd-qt: a Qt frontend for the wicd daemon.

It's still very buggy!

This requires the following:

* A running daemon from wicd 1.4.1 (may include it here in the future)

* A working PyQt 4

Run "sh build_res.sh" to compile the UI files and icons.
Then run "python wicd.py" and it should appear in your tray. 
Click on the tray icon to see the main window.
